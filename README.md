<h1>Linear Regression</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Simple Linear Regression - Relationship between 2(dependent and independent) variables.
Linear refers to increase/decrease in dependant variable (Y) with increase/decrease in independent variable (X).
Equation of line: Y= mX +c
y=mx+c

y is the dependent variable (the variable we're trying to predict or explain).
x is the independent variable (the variable used to make predictions).
m is the slope of the line.
c is the y-intercept.

Purpose: Establish relationship between variables (X and Y), by finding c (y-intercept) & m (slope) – equation of linear line.
Methods to train data/finding the most appropriate line: Least squares, in this we find the line with lowest sum of all errors(how far the points are from the line)

Least Squares Regression:
m =  (N*Σ(xy) − Σx*Σy)/ (N*Σ(x*x) − (Σx)*(Σx))
b =  (Σy − m*Σx)/N
