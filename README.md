<h1>Linear Regression</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Simple Linear Regression - Relationship between 2(dependent and independent) variables.
Linear refers to increase/decrease in depde with increase/decrease in independent variable.
Equation: Y= mx +c 
Purpose: Establish relationship between variables (x, &y), by finding c (y-intercept) & m (slope) â€“ equation of linear line. In other words, establishing relation within x&y by training data, to predict y for x.
Methods to train data/ finding the most appropriate line: Least squares, in this we find the line with lowest sum of all errors(how far the point is from the line)
